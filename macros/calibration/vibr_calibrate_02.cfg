# CHANGELOG:
#   v1.0: first speed and vibrations optimization macro


### What is it ? ###
# This macro helps you to identify the speed settings that exacerbate the vibrations of the machine (ie. where the frame resonate badly).
# It also helps to find the clean speed ranges where the machine is silent.
# I had some strong vibrations at very specific speeds on my machine (52mm/s for example) and I wanted to find all these problematic speeds
# to avoid them in my slicer profile and finally get the silent machine I was dreaming!

# It works by moving the toolhead at different speed settings while recording the vibrations using the ADXL chip. Then the macro call a custom script
# to compute and find the best speed settings. The results can be found in your config folder using Fluidd/Mainsail file manager.

# The goal is to make it easy to set, share and use it.

# This macro is parametric and most of the values can be adjusted with their respective input parameters.
# It can be called without any parameters - in which case the default values would be used - or with any combination of parameters as desired.

# Installation:
#   1. Copy this file and include it in your Klipper config
#   2. Be sure to have the gcode_shell_command.py Klipper extension installed (easiest way to install it is to use KIAUH in the Advanced section)
#   3. Add plot_graphs.sh somewhere in your config. You can find this file in my scripts folder
#   3bis. Make it executable using SSH: type 'chmod +x ./plot_graphs.sh' when in the folder
#   4. Add graph_vibrations.py in the same folder in your config. You can find this file in my scripts folder
#   4bis. Make it executable using SSH: type 'chmod +x ./graph_vibrations.py' when in the folder.
#   5. Add the correct shell_command to your config to be able to call the plot_graphs script (as in my shell_commands.cfg file in the scripts folder)
#   6. (Optional) You can configure the results folder in the first lines of the plot_graphs.sh script. Default: ~/klipper_config/adxl_results

# Usage:
#   1. DO YOUR INPUT SHAPER CALIBRATION FIRST !!! This macro should not be used before as it would be useless and the results invalid.
#   2. Call the VIBRATIONS_CALIBRATION macro with the speed range you want to measure (default 20 to 200mm/s with 2mm/s increment).
#      Be carefull about the Z_HEIGHT variable that default to 20mm -> if your ADXL is under the nozzle, increase it to avoid a crash of the ADXL on the bed of the machine.
#   3. Wait for it to finish all the measurement and compute the graph. Then look at it in the results folder.
