    ## The following is absolutely critical: set the overvoltage snubber to a sensible voltage.
    ## This should be set to about 0.8 V above your power supply's idle voltage.
    ## Your PSU voltage can be read from the TMC 2240 by issuing a GCODE command:
    ## DUMP_TMC stepper=extruder register=ADC_VSUPPLY_AIN
    ## The voltage is the value of adc_vsupply multiplied by 0.009732
    ## It is also possible to use adc_vsupply + 82 here, which works out to be the same.
    #{% set v = (24.7/0.009732)|int %}
    #SET_TMC_FIELD STEPPER=extruder FIELD=OVERVOLTAGE_VTH VALUE={ v }
