## PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING:
## -64 is the most sensitive value, 63 is the least sensitive. Here we set a default

## Follow the Klipper documentation here: https://www.klipper3d.org/TMC_Drivers.html#sensorless-homing
## to find the best suited SGTHRS value according to your machine. Then you can put it in your overrides

# [tmc2240 stepper_x]
# driver_SGT: xxx

# [tmc2240 stepper_y]
# driver_SGT: xxx
