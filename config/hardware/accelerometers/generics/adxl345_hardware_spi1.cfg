# This ADXL file is dedicated to be used with ADXL boards
# connected over the SPI bus of the MCU boards on "spi1"

# This include most Mellow toolhead boards such as SHT boards, ...
# But also Octopus, etc...

# If using a toolhead board, be sure to have the pin override in your mcu.cfg (toolhead:ADXL_CS)
