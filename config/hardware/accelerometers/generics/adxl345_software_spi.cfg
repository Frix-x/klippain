# This ADXL file is dedicated to be used with ADXL boards
# connected over the software SPI bus of the MCU boards

# This include most BTT toolhead boards such as EBB boards, SB2209, SB2240,
# but also some Mellow boards such as the Fly-SB2040, ...
# If using a toolhead board, be sure to have the pin override in your mcu.cfg (toolhead:ADXL_CS)
