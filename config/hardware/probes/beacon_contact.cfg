# This probe type is for a Beacon probe used directly as a virtual Z endstop
# rather than with an existing physical endstop. To use this configuration,
# you will need to manually add the Beacon Klipper plugin!

## Then, you should just add the following two lines to your overrides and everything should work!
## The rest of the allowed config entries are available on this link: config/hardware/probes/inductive_virtual.cfg
