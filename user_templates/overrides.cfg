######## USER CONFIG OVERRIDES FILE #########  + --> This will help you personalize my config to your printer :)
############################################# /

# This file is yours! Feel free to edit it in order to include all the needed
# things to adapt my generic config to your machine. Also, keep in mind
# that it will not be erased when updating the config using moonraker
# and it will be kept as you've set it.
# You can change every section of the config. You can also add some new custom macros, etc...

### Also, keep in mind: if you use a multi-MCU config such as the old school double SKRs or a CANbus toolhead
### board, you will need to specify which components are connected to which board in your own mcu.cfg file!
### Example: if something is connected to the toolhead MCU, you should use "config_pin: toolhead:PIN_NAME".

#> Main control MCUs are called "mcu" (and "secondary" when using a double SKR config)
#> Toolhead CANboard MCUs are called "toolhead"
#> ERCF MCUs are called "ercf"

#   Z DIRECTION CHANGE EXAMPLE   #
#--------------------------------#

# This is just an example of how to do a basic override of
# one entry of a [section] like here just change the direction
# by adding a ! in front of the pin. But you can override
# everything in the same way!

# [stepper_z]
# dir_pin: !mcu:Z_DIR

# [stepper_z2]
# dir_pin: !mcu:Z2_DIR
