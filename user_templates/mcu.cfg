# This file is yours: keep in mind that it will not be erased when updating
# the config using moonraker and it will be kept as you've set it.

# Put here all your wiring definitions, your MCU serial port, CANbus UUID, etc...
# It should be populated automatically with some default wiring templates during
# the first time install of the config if you choose to do so when asked by the
# script. If it's not the case, you will need to manually define all your
# [board_pins] section. You can use the pinout documentation here: ./docs/pinout.md
