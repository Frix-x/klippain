# Those overrides are automatically added when you select the SB2240 
# toolhead MCU during the installation process. They should provide a
# good base to work with. Feel free to adapt to your board if needed!


# Since ADXL shares pins with the SPI interface of the TMC, it must be set up here, since different pin aliases must not resolve to the same pin
